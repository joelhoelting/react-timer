## React Timer

React Timer is a desktop-first pomodoro timer inpsired by a timer I frequently use: [tomato-timer.com](https://tomato-timer.com). It's also my first React project. I liked many of the features of that timer but I wanted to implement other features that I felt would be useful.

#### Features
1. Settings for Custom Pomodoro & Break Intervals
2. Choose an Audio Alert from 5 Different Sounds
3. Utilizes local storage to Persist Settings in Case Browser Closes/Refreshes
4. Timer is Visible in Browser Tab for Easy Viewing While in Other Tabs

## Install & Run

To install and run this project locally:

`npm install && npm run`

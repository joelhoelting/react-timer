## React Timer

React times is a pomodoro timer inpsired by a timer I frequently use: [tomato-timer.com](tomato-timer.com). I liked many of the features of that timer but I wanted to implement features that I felt would be useful. It was a fun challenge to implement all of the features from that timer in a new project. Perfect project for a state-based Javascript library like React.

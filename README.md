## React Timer

React Timer is a lightweight and minimalistic pomodoro timer inpsired by [tomato-timer.com](https://tomato-timer.com). It's also my first React project. I liked many of the features of tomato-timer.com but I wanted to implement other features that I thought would be useful.

#### Features
1. Settings for Custom Pomodoro & Break Intervals
2. Choose an Audio Alert from 5 Different Sounds
3. Utilizes local storage to Persist Settings in Case Browser Closes/Refreshes
4. Timer is Visible in Browser Tab for Easy Viewing While in Other Tabs

#### Wishlist
1. Track completed pomodoros (w/ option to reset)
2. Timer switches to short break after each pomodoro, switches to long break after 4 pomodoros
3. Display a checkmark/tomato/indicator after each completed pomodoro
4. Add new audio files
